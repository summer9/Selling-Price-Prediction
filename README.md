# Selling-Price-Prediction
This is a project using Numerical Method in Python. Our team wanted to predict the selling price of a specific products.
Difficulties: Finding data. We find data on Kaggle and take one product which have the variety price. We aimed to find data about a familiar products. However, we do not have time to find the data that we want.
Math behinds Python method: we using single, multiple linear regression. 
- Simple linear regression:    Simple linear regression aims to find a linear relationship to describe the correlation between an independent and dependent variable.
- Multiple linear regression:
- Mean squared Error: MSE shows how closed the predicted value are to the actual value and it more sensitive to outliers
- R^2 score: explain how well the regression model fit the data. It less sensitive than MSE
