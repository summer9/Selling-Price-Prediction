# Selling-Price-Prediction
This project involves using numerical methods in Python. Our team aimed to predict the selling price of specific products.
**Difficulties**
One of the main challenges was finding appropriate data. We found a dataset on Kaggle titled Amazon Sales Dataset and selected a product with varying prices. Initially, we aimed to find data on familiar products, but we did not have enough time to gather the specific data we wanted
Daata on Kaggle: <[Amazone sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mehakiftikhar/amazon-sales-dataset-eda/input)> 

**Math behinds Python method**
We used single and multiple linear regression for our predictions.
- Simple Linear Regression: Simple linear regression finds a linear relationship that describes the correlation between an independent and a dependent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: This extends linear regression to involve multiple independent variables.
  
**Evaluation Metrics**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE shows how close the predicted values are to the actual values. It is sensitive to outliers
- R² Score: The R² score explains how well the regression model fits the data. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE. We can use the model for making predictions.
